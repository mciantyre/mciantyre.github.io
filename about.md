I'm Ian.

I studied biological signal processing and control systems at the University of Pittsburgh. Nowadays, I'm found in and around Pittsburgh working on software for medical devices; biking where bikers probably shouldn't bike; and generally geeking out.

This blog is not only a place for me to share information and ramble, but also an outlet for me to enhance my writing. I love feedback, so please open issues, start pull requests, or reach out if something is unclear.
