I'm Ian.

I studied biological signal processing and control systems at the University of Pittsburgh. Nowadays, I'm found around Pittsburgh working on software; biking where bikers probably shouldn't bike; and generally geeking out.

This blog is not only a place for me to ramble, but also an outlet for me to practice my writing. I love feedback, so please open issues, start pull requests, or reach out if something is unclear.
